# IAL C Data Structures

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in C, specifically focusing on lists and queues. Each implementation follows the guidelines provided by the faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology as part of their Algorithms course.

## Files

- `c201.c`: Implementation of a singly linked list (jednosměrný lineární seznam) with operations such as initialization, destruction, and element manipulation (insert, delete, get, set).
- `c203.c`: Implementation of a character queue using a static array (fronta znaků v poli), including functions to initialize the queue, check its status (empty or full), and perform element insertion and removal.
- `c206.c`: Implementation of a doubly linked list (dvousměrně vázaný lineární seznam) with methods for working with the list such as adding and removing elements, as well as accessing and modifying data within the elements.
